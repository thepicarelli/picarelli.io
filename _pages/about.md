This is Chloe's blog--wow why am I talking in third person? This is a window into my kitchen, bookshelf, closet, life, and basically anything I want my fingers to type (although if you know me well, you know I prefer the smell of paper, but this will have to do until I publish my own magazine, mark my words). I've done a little bit of everything in my life: was famous on YouTube, professional makeup artist, fashion icon, impressionist, dancer, concert attendee. I settled down here in the small town of Jacksonville, picked up bread-making before it was cool, and have been baked ever since. Here's what I want you to know I've [read](/reads). Here's what I want you to read, but this time I'm the [author](/blog/). If you can't read, [photos](https://www.icloud.com/sharedalbum/#B0iJtdOXmkYghC). 

This spring, I'm working with [Sidney](https://shough.me) on Chord, a consumer AI startup.

You might want to see my [projects](https://github.com/kliu128) or
[tweets](https://twitter.com/kliu128). If you have cool thoughts, know the fundamental causes of the 1970s Great Stagnation, or just want to reach out, don't hesitate to contact me through
